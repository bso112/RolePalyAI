# RolePalyAI
Chat App using OpenAI's Completions API
This projecs allows you to create a character of your choosing. ChatGPT will embody the character you've created.

For instance, if you'd like to engage in a conversation with Iron Man from the Marvel movies, you can designate Iron Man as your character. Just provide a description of Iron Man's name, personality, and other traits, and ChatGPT will assume the role of Iron Man.

To Build this project, you'll need to obtain your OpenAI API key. Then, insert your API key into the local.properties file as shown below. (If you don't have a local.properties file, you can create one.)


```
CHAT_GPT_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```
